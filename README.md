# ChronoShift-game
Python platformer made with Pygame. 
The game uses python classes to handle entities of the game such as enemies or enemy projectiles. 
The player has time related abilities such as stopping time or rewinding time to go back to the position they were in few seconds ago. 
Unfortunately the Pygame library is a little broken and the script no longer runs.
